	   <h1>Mochizuki Chiyome: The Most Famous Kunoichi (lady ninja)</h1>
	   <p>She was a noblewoman, the wife of samurai warlord Mochizuki Nobumasa, and rumored to be originally from the Koga ninja clan. Sometime during the 16th century, her husband was away at war and Chiyome was left in the care of her husband’s uncle, famed daimyo Takeda Shingen. Shingen approached Chiyome and gave her a mission to recruit women and train them as an underground network of female espionage operatives. Chiyome set up headquarters at Nazu village in the Shinshu region and recruited up to 300 young women—mostly orphans, former prostitutes, and war victims. While most locals believed that Chiyome was running an unofficial orphanage for victimized girls, Chiyome was in truth training them to be part of her elaborate espionage network. Trained to utilize disguises such as miko (Shinto shrine priestess), prostitutes, or geisha for purposes of espionage or assassination, Chiyome’s kunoichi network served Shingen for years until his mysterious death in 1573.</p>
