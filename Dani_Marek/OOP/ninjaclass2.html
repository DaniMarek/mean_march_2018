// Complete the below challenges using the Ninja Class from the previous assignment. You may skip the functionality related to private variables.

// .punch()
// Add a new method to your Ninja class called .punch(). This method will take another Ninja instance and subtract 5 Health from the Ninja we passed in. Your .punch() should display a console message like "Goemon was punched by Bill Gates and lost 5 Health!"
// .kick()
// Now add a method to your Ninja class called .kick(). Kick will subtract 15 Health for each point of Strength the calling Ninja has, and like .punch() will take another Ninja instance.
