1. Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
use my_first_db

2. Create students collection.
db.createCollection("students")

3. Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name:   STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER,  year: NUMBER}})
 Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
db.students.insert({name: "Xochitl", home_state: "Texas", lucky_number: 9, birthday: {month: 7, day: 15, year: 1982}})
db.students.insert({name: "Moises", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 8, birthday: {month: 2, day: 15, year: 1988}})
db.students.insert({name: "Esther", home_state: "Seattle", lucky_number: 6, birthday: {month: 5, day: 15, year: 1990}})
db.students.insert({name: "Tlaloc", home_state: "Texas", lucky_number: 3, birthday: {month: 3, day: 13, year: 1983}})
db.students.insert({name: "Shoshana", home_state: "Texas", lucky_number: 9, birthday: {month: 4, day: 19, year: 1991}})

4. Get all students.
db.students.find().pretty

5. Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.find({home_state: {$in: ["California", "Washington"]}}).pretty()


6. Get all students whose lucky number is:
	a. greater than 3
	b. less than or equal to 10
	c. between 1 and 9 (inclusive)

db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}})
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})
db.students.find({$and: [{lucky_number: {$gte: 1}}, {lucky_number: {$lte: 9}}]})


7. Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should  contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {interests: ["Coding", "Brunch", "MongoDB"]}})

8. Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
db.students.update({name: "Xochitl"}, {$push: {interests: "Dance"}})
db.students.update({name: "Moises", {$push: {interests: "Swimming"}})
db.students.update({name: "Esther", {$push: {interests: "Social Justice"}})
db.students.update({name: "Tlaloc", {$push: {interests: "Guitar"}})
db.students.update({name: "Shoshana", {$push {interests: "Travel"}})

9. Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
db.students.update({name: "Shoshana", {$push {interests: "Taxes"}})

10. Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
db.students.update({name: "Shoshana", {$pull {interests: "Taxes"}})

11. Remove all students who are from California (or Washington).
db.students.deleteMany({home_state: {$in: ["California", "Washington"]}})

12. Remove a student by name. 
db.students.deleteOne({name: "Xochitl"})


13. Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
db.students.deleteOne({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}})

14. Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0}})


15. Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.updateMany({home_state: "Florida"}, {$inc: {number_of_belts: 1}})


16. Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
db.students.updateMany({}, {$rename: {'number_of_belts': 'belts_earned'}})

17. Remove the 'lucky_number' field.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$unset: {lucky_number: ""}})


18. Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$currentDate: {updated_on: true}})
